Description : This Python script is designed to analyze card-related data stored in a CSV file and generate a well-structured PDF report summarizing key insights. It reads the CSV data and processes each row to extract important attributes such as card type (credit or debit), chip availability, exposure on the dark web, and credit limit values. The script calculates several statistics, including the total number of cards, the number of credit and debit cards, how many have chips, how many are listed on the dark web, and computes the average credit limit. These insights are visually represented using a bar chart created with Matplotlib, which is saved as an image and later embedded in the final report. The PDF is generated using the FPDF library and includes a title, a clearly formatted summary table with borders, and the chart image. This approach ensures both textual and visual representation of the analyzed data, making the report suitable for quick reviews or presentations. Additionally, the script includes a feature to automatically open the generated PDF file, enhancing user convenience. It is cross-platform compatible, handling file opening across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Overall, this tool offers a streamlined solution for transforming raw card data into a polished, readable report.
